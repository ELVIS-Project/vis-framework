Hi Christopher,

This seems like a good idea given our web format.  You've got my vote.

Dear Jamie and Alex:

I would like to relicense the software we are developing for the ELVIS
Project. As you are both copyright holders, I am asking your consent.
The current licence for the software in question is the "GNU General
Public License," version 3 or any later. I would like to change the
licence to "GNU Affero General Public License," version 3 or any later.

I believe the AGPL will protect our users' rights to a greater extent
than the GPL because our software is designed to be run on a server. You
may read a longer explanation of my motivations here:
https://www.gnu.org/licenses/why-affero-gpl.html

You may read the licences themselves here:
https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html
https://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl.html

If you wish to discuss the relicensing effort, I would be happy to
consider other options.

The affected software is that currently contained in the "vis-vm,"
"django-vis" and "vis" repositories on our project's GitHub page:
https://github.com/ELVIS-Project/vis-vm
https://github.com/ELVIS-Project/vis
https://github.com/ELVIS-Project/django-vis

To complete the relicensing effort, if you consent, please respond to
this email in a way that unambiguously notes your consent to relicense
the software. Ideally, your response will be signed with a GPG key for
which the public key is publicly accessible. If not, I will sign your
response. I will include the responses in the "doc" directory in each
affected repository.

You can verify the validity of this message with the
"letter_to_relicense.txt" and "letter_to_relicense.txt.asc" files in the
"doc" subdirectory of the "vis" repository. The files are currently only
present in the "visX-devel" branch, but will be merged to master in the
future.


Thank you for your attention,
Christopher Antila
