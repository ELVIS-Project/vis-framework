Documentation for the ``vis`` Music Analysis Framework
======================================================
This is the documentation for the ``vis`` music analysis framework.

If you are a programmer who wishes to use the ``vis`` Python objects directly, to use the framework as part of another project, or to add functionality to your own instance of the ``vis`` Web app or VisTrails modules, this is the documentation you should read.

If you are not a programmer, if you wish to learn about computer-driven music analysis, or if you are looking for documentation on the ``vis`` Web app or VisTrails interface, this is not the documentation you should read. Hopefully I will produce the documentation you want---when I do, I will link to it from here, to help you find it.

``vis`` is a free software Python package produced by the McGill University team of the "ELVIS Project." I'll write a bit more about what "free software" means, what "Python package" means, and what the "ELVIS Project" is.
